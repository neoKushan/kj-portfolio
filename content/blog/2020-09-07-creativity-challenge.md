I've been feeling a little creatively stifled recently, as a flare up has made it difficult for me to concentrate on that part as much as I would like.  This means that my brain is flooded with creative ideas and it feels a little overwhelming.  So I've decided to set myself a challenge. It's 21 days till my birthday. So for the next 21 days I'm going to write a poem every day.\
\
I've found prompts by making a list of 7 places that have importance to me and using the website "what three words" to get the 3 words assigned to those places. I've then randomised those words for privacy and to remove the association when I'm writing. Below you can see the words I'm left with.  



I'll be posting the poems here under my poems section and on my instagram, and I might include other art work too if I have the time and feel so inclined. 



Feel free to join me! You can use my prompts or find your own using the same method I did. Use the hashtag #poorlypoetry. 



And whether you join or read, enjoy and be safe <3
