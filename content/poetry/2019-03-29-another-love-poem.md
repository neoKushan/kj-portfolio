If you write poems at 3 o'clock in the morning they're going to be cheesy...

I am lying there

In a sticky, sweaty pool of someone else's played out sexual desires

I have enjoyed myself-ish

But now the air is so heavy with the weight of words I don't want to say

I wonder how I am even breathing

I am a writer

Words should be my forte

The only tool in my proverbial box 

But now they escape me

It's been so long since I've felt them

I've had flings that feel like electricity

Moments that taste like chemistry

I am the kind to carelessly rip out my heart

And always proudly show all of my cards

Make bargains and deals 

Bets if you will

With my heart on the line

But I am a writer and I have learnt that nothing is more painful than when that bond of words is broken

Had I love yous that became I hate yous

I need yous that became I can't even stand the sight of yous

I became jaded

Started doing the maths

Considering the odds

They were never favourable

And when I didn't really feel it nothing seemed more painful 

Than saying words I might have to take back one day

And then one day

I am lying with you 

In a sticky, sweaty pool of our played out sexual desires

I have enjoyed myself thoroughly

I have barely had chance to catch my breath 

Before you lean in closer and say

I love you

You are not a writer but you don't have any problem with words

Crawled inside my head and made yourself at home

Constantly finishing my

Sandwiches 

Our chemistry makes pastries not poison

Our electricity lights cities not villages

I look into your eyes and 

Everything around me goes a little bit hazy

And now you've ripped out your heart

Placed it between us with all of your cards 

It is a bargain

A deal

A bet if you will

My heart for yours

But I am a writer and I know nothing is more painful than when that bond of words is broken

Your promise reminds me of all the promises others refused to keep

All the I love yous that became I hate yous

All the I need yous that became I can't even stand the sight of yous

I do the maths

Consider the odds

They are not favourable

But I am a writer and I realise

The only thing more painful than hearing words you might have to take back some day

Is never saying them in the first place

The math doesn't add up

The odds are not in my favour

But I love you
