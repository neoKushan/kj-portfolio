> I don't know what inspired me  
> To reply to  
> Hey Baby  
> But I guess I was really bored when you called    
> Within a week we’d agreed to meet  
> Had to be somewhere public  
> Chose the Christmas markets  
> Could have been romantic  
> Only halfway there I realised I didn’t actually know your name  
> Hoped I’d figure it out somehow along the way  
> And when our eyes met that didn’t seem to matter  
> Our connection was  
> Instantaneous  
> I don’t know if it was the cold winter breeze in the air that night or the way the Christmas lights danced above our heads but our chemistry was  
> Undeniable  
> And so we talked  
> And drank  
> And laughed  
> And dance  
> And kissed  
> And in what felt like a blink of an eye  
> I was sat on your bed  
> Your hand halfway up my top  
> When I stopped and blushed and bit my lip and said  
> “I don’t usually do this sort of thing”  
> This wasn’t true  
> But I’d been taught to lie to boys like you and always protect my virtue  
> As for the rest of the details  
> Well a gentleman never tells  
> Safe to say you became my warning story  
> The first fuckboy I ever encountered  
> A few months worth of mistakes that me and my friends would laugh about even half a decade later  
> But even half a decade later  
> You were on my mind  
> Wonder why  
> Think back to that night  
> Your one hand resting on my thigh  
> As I sighed and stopped and blushed and bit my lip and said   
> “I don't usually do this sort of thing”  
> And didn't mean it  
> Because although you smirked  
> You pulled back and said   
> “Do you want to?”  
> And I said  
> “Yes!”  
> And for the first time I meant it  
>   
> You see I’d been led to believe that my sexuality didn’tt belong to me   
> That it was a tool  
> To be used  
> By boys like you  
> Broken and bruised  
> And I’d said yes before and at the time it had felt like I meant it  
> But looking back now without the rose tinted spectacles of my youth  
> I could see the red flags  
> I could see that yes hadn’t always meant Yes  
> Yes had been a metaphor  
> For Something so much more, yes had meant  
> If it will make you like me  
> Isn’t that what you do when someones tells you they love you?  
> If you stop sending dick pics to my friends then yes  
> Yes had meant  
> What other choice do I have  
> I can’t say no from underneath your hand  
> If you'll just stop hurting me than yes  
> But with you yes means yes  
> It meant  
> Yes please  
> Touch me immediately  
> I’ve spent all night thinking how it might feel for you to fuck me  
> So yes  
> And it would be the same for all the guys who  
> Came  
> After you  
> Yes only ever meant yes  
> And when I meant “no” I said  
> No  
> or  
> Fuck off  
> Or on one occasion  
> When no and fuck off ‘weren’t enough’  
> Shoved a guy off  
> And slapped him across the face  
> And that was the end of that friendship  
> You were the first time I said yes and meant it  
> But this didn't belong to you  
> This epiphany belonged to me  
> And I wish I could find the switch  
> Wish I could write it down for other girls who’d been  
> Just like me  
> Lied to about their sexuality  
> Even though they’d roll their eyes and tell me they know exactly what they're doing  
> I could say oh sweetie  
> When you look back on this without the rose tinted spectacles of your youth  
> When you see those red flags  
> Don’t blame yourself the way I did  
> Your sexuality is not a tool  
> It is only to be used  
> By you  
> and  
> For you  
> It is a precious flower for you to cultivate and grow  
> It is a beautiful gift so tie it neatly with a bow  
> And present it to   
> Whoever you want  
> Whenever you want  
> But only ever because you want  
>
