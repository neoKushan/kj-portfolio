> Don’t call me precocious\
> Or suggest I have grown too big for these boots\
> We both know these boots weren't meant for feet that want to grow\
> And Explore\
> And find something more than what this small town has to offer\
> Don’t call me a dyke\
> Just because I got kissing Sarah Summers behind the bikeshed\
> I also really want to kiss boys behind the bikeshed\
> So I guess that means I’m not a dyke\
> Don't call me a slag\
> Because of all the boys I’ve kissed behind the bikeshed\
> They are teaching me that my body is currency and they are the ones with buying privilege\
> Don’t call me a fridge\
> Because I refuse to kiss you behind the bikeshed\
> Even slags have standards\
> Don’t call me a liar\
> I meant it when I said I’d love you forever\
> But I was 14 and sometimes people change\
> Don’t call me strange\
> Because I don't fit into the boxes society has made for me\
> Don’t call my flaky or tell me I have lost my sparkle\
> I know I said we’d meet today but the world seems scary\
> And angry\
> I can’t trust anything past my bedroom door\
> Maybe instead of calling me flaky you should ask if I’m ok\
> Don't call me crazy\
> Because I figured you out for the manipulative cunt you are\
> Don’t call me two faced\
> I have learnt things and my politics have changed\
> Don’t tell me I and drowning in\
> Heterosexual privilege\
> Because I won’t let you\
> Touch my clitoris\
> I know it is easier for me than it ever has been for you\
> But it has never been easy for me\
> Still have scars from where they pulled the hair from my scalp\
> And besides\
> I still really want to fuck women in bikesheds so I guess I’m not heterosexual\
> Don't call me a feminazi because I won’t stop screaming about equality\
> Don't call me a hypocrite because my feminist politics don’t match up with my bedroom antics\
> I can be a feminazi in the street\
> And a\
> Slut in the sheets\
> And that’s got nothing to do with you baby\
> Don’t call me a slut\
> Unless I ask you to\
> Really really nicely\
> Don’t call me greedy\
> Because I don't buy into your idea of the gender binary or monogamy\
> Don’t tell me I can’t have my cake and eat it\
> What is the point of cake\
> If no one's going to eat it\
> Don’t call me bubbly\
> If you mean lively and friendly and vibrant then say that\
> Because when I hear bubbly I hear\
> Annoying and fat\
> And I don’t want you to call me that\
> Don’t call me fat\
> Only I’m allowed to call me fat\
> And when I call me fat\
> Don’t say “Katie you’re not fat you’re beautiful”\
> I happen to believe\
> I can be both\
> Don’t call me beautiful\
> Unless you’re willing to list several things about me you find beautiful\
> Including my personality\
> Because honey these insecurities\
> Run really really deep\
> Don’t call me difficult\
> Because I’m not willing to let you call me\
> Whatever you feel like calling me\
> I have and always will be a\
> Precocious Little Shit\
> And I’m not willing to fit into your dictionary definition of me
